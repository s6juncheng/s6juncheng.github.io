I'm a researcher interested in machine learning for biomedicine. I'm currently a research scientist at NEC labs. 
I did my PhD at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) with [Julien Gagneur](https://www.in.tum.de/gagneurlab/home/) on computational biology. 
I was also a visiting student with [Anshul Kundaje](https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/Home). I did a research internship at Amazon on contextual bandits for personalized recommendations.
As a master student, I worked with [Christoph Dieterich](http://dieterichlab.org/) on circRNAs in Ageing and [Maria von Korff Schmising](https://www.mpipz.mpg.de/von_korff) on circadian clock of flowering time control.

## My research
My research focuses on the development and application of machine learning methods on large-scale biological data for more precise understanding of human disease. 
The methods can be used, for example, to diagnose genetic diseases, to select biomarkers, to stratify cancer patients, 
and to design effective vaccines. I’m passionate about drawing insights from complex biological data and developing methods with high impact applications. 
I’m also interested in pushing the state-of-the-art in machine learning.
